#SPIDER-MAN RUNNER 2D

### DESCRIPTION OF MY PROJECT
My first videogame with Unity and C#.

### DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME 
This is a regular runner in 2D. The player is a Spider-man box that has to take items and jump from one platform to another without jumping or fall out of the screen.
It's an infinite game.

### CONTROLS 

    --Press SPACEBAR to make the player jumps.
    --Press Alt + f4 (on Windows) to get out of the game.
    
### ITEMS

    --SpiderGwen -> Add 1 point to player's score
    --Spider-man 2099 -> Add 1 Point to player's score
    --Venom -> Descrease 1 Point to player's score
    --Carnage -> Decrease 1 Point to player's score
    --Superior Spider-man -> Changes player's avatar, increase speed, change roles of previews items for 25 secs.
    For Example: Spider-man takes SpiderGwen item -> player's score plus 1 point
                 Spider-man Superior takes SpiderGwen item -> player's score decrease 1 point.
    Note: Superior Spider-man's speed can still be increased if the player takes more than 1 in a row.         
                 
### DEATH

    --Getting the player's box out of the screen, jumping too high or falling too low.
